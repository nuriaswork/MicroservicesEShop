In NuGet console:
	1. database connection by EF must be set up properly in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(option =>option.UseXXX("connection"));
	2.select the correct project and execute

PM> add-migration <name>					just creates the files needed
PM> update-database							aplies changes from the files to the database


For not having to run "update-database" every time, we'll be implementing in Program.cs a method that will
apply pending migrations.
