1. All endpoints of the same API return the same class (ResponseDto).

2. Consumers will create same class ResponseDto. As projects may not be in the same solution, as in this teaching case,
is better to have the classes replicated, although it looks worse, it adapts to real world. Is important to keep models
isolated to their corresponding project in Microservices architecture.

3. Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) in production for tell browsers to only user HTTPS. Prevents protocol downgrade 
and some man-in-the-middle attacks). How it works: server sends the Strict-Transport-Security response header with a 
max-age. While max-age is in effect the browser will refuse HTTP for the domain. Optional directives: includeSubDomains, preload.
app.UseHsts();

4. Set a fixed route for API controllers, so the name of the controller can change but the route is the same, so the services that call the 
API do not have to be updated: [Route("api/coupon")]

5. For frontend validations, it's already included <WebProject>\Views\Shared\_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml with predefined jQuery scripts. 
Add @section Scripts { <partial name="_ValidationScriptsPartial" /> } to the View and use it with asp-for & asp-validation-for.
