1. All endpoints of the same API return the same class (ResponseDto).

2. Consumers will create same class ResponseDto. As projects may not be in the same solution, as in this teaching case,
is better to have the classes replicated, although it looks worse, it adapts to real world. Is important to keep models
isolated to their corresponding project in Microservices architecture.

3. Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) in production for tell browsers to only user HTTPS. Prevents protocol downgrade 
and some man-in-the-middle attacks). How it works: server sends the Strict-Transport-Security response header with a 
max-age. While max-age is in effect the browser will refuse HTTP for the domain. Optional directives: includeSubDomains, preload.
app.UseHsts();
