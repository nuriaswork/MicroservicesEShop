1. All endpoints of the same API return the same class (ResponseDto).

2. Consumers will create same class ResponseDto. As projects may not be in the same solution, as in this teaching case,
is better to have the classes replicated, although it looks worse, it adapts to real world. Is important to keep models
isolated to their corresponding project in Microservices architecture.
